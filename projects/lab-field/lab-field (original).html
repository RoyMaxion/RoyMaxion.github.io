Q1-1: What is keystroke dynamics (or keystroke biometrics)?
</DIV>

<DIV id="q1-1"><DIV class="ans">

Keystroke dynamics is the study of whether people can be distinguished
by their typing rhythms, much like handwriting is used to identify the
author of a written text.  Possible applications include acting as an
electronic fingerprint, or in an access-control mechanism.  A digital
fingerprint would tie a person to a computer-based crime in the same
manner that a physical fingerprint ties a person to the scene of a
physical crime.  Access control could incorporate keystroke dynamics
both by requiring a legitimate user to type a password with the
correct rhythm, and by continually authenticating that user while they
type on the keyboard.

<LI> <DIV class="hdr" onclick="switchDisplay('q1-2');">
Q1-2: What is your paper about?  What is this webpage for?
</DIV>

<DIV id="q1-2"><DIV class="ans">

In the field of keystroke dynamics, there are many different methods of collecting timing data from subjects. A data collection program can run in the browser, separate copies of the program can run on the personal computer of each subject, or a single program can run on one computer in a laboratory setting. In our paper, we show that collecting data outside of the laboratory setting can result in low-quality data. <BR><BR>


Our intent with this webpage is to share our resources&mdash;the typing data,
evaluation scripts, and the table of results&mdash;with the research
community, and to answer questions that they (or you) might have.

Q2-1: How were the data collected?
</DIV>

<DIV id="q2-1"><DIV class="ans">
    
For complete details of our data collection methodology, we refer
readers to our original paper <A HREF="#ref1">[1]</A>.  A brief
summary of our methodology follows.<BR><BR>
    
<B>Lab:</B><BR><BR>

We built a keystroke data-collection apparatus consisting of: (1) a
laptop running Windows XP; (2) a Windows software application for presenting
stimuli to the subjects, and for recording their keystrokes; and (3)
an external reference timer for timestamping those keystrokes.  The
software presents the subject with the password to be typed.  As the
subject types the password, it is checked for correctness.  If the
subject makes a typographical error, the application prompts the
subject to retype the password.  In this manner, we record timestamps
for 50 correctly typed passwords in each session.<BR><BR>

Whenever the subject presses or releases a key, the software
application records the event (i.e., keydown or keyup), the name of
the key involved, and a timestamp for the moment at which the
keystroke event occurred.  An external reference clock was used to
generate highly accurate timestamps.  The reference clock was
demonstrated to be accurate to within &#xb1;200 microseconds (by using
a function generator to simulate key presses at fixed
intervals).<BR><BR>

We recruited 100 subjects (typists) from within a university community.
All subjects typed the same password, and each subject typed the
password 400 times over 8 sessions (50 repetitions per session).  They
waited at least one day between sessions, to capture some of the
day-to-day variation of each subject's typing.  The password
(<CODE>.tie5Roanl</CODE>) was chosen to be representative of a strong
10-character password.<BR><BR>

The raw records of all the subjects' keystrokes and timestamps were
analyzed to create a password-timing table.  The password-timing table
encodes the timing features for each of the 400 passwords that each
subject typed.<BR><BR>
    
<B>Field:</B><BR><BR>
 
The same Windows application used to collect data for our lab dataset was 
adapted to run on the personal computer of each subject in our field dataset. 
Keystrokes were timestamped using two onboard timers available to Windows
programs: the Query Performance Counter (QPC) for high-resolution timestamps 
and the Tick Timer for standard, low-resolution timestamps. Only timing data 
from the QPC is presented in the field dataset; the Tick Timer timestamps were 
used for sanity-checking our results.<BR><BR>
    
We recruited 100 subjects from various university communities. All 100 
subjects are distinct from the subjects in the lab dataset&mdash;there are no
subjects who contributed to both datasets. As in the lab dataset, all subjects
typed the same password (<CODE>.tie5Roanl</CODE>), and each subject typed the 
password 400 times over 8 sessions (50 repetitions per session). <BR><BR>

The password-timing table for the field data was generated from the raw data 
in the same manner as the password-timing table for the lab data. Likewise, 
the field data password-timing table encodes the timing features for each of 
the 400 passwords that each subject typed.<BR><BR>

<LI> <DIV class="hdr" onclick="switchDisplay('q2-2');">
Q2-2: How do I read the data into R / Matlab / Weka / Excel / ...?
</DIV>

<DIV id="q2-2"><DIV class="ans">

The data are provided in three different formats to make it easier for
researchers visiting this page to view and manipulate the data.  In
all its forms, the data are organized into a table, but different
applications are better suited to different formats.<BR><BR>

<I>(R)</I>: In the <A HREF="DSL-StrongPasswordData.txt">fixed-width
format</A>, the columns of the table are separated by one or more
spaces so that the information in each column is aligned vertically.
This format is easy to read in a standard web browser or document
editor with a fixed width font.  It can also be read by the standard
data-input mechanisms of the statistical-programming environment <A
HREF="http://www.r-project.org">R</A>.  Specifically, the
<CODE>read.table</CODE> command can be used to read the data into a
structure called a <CODE>data.frame</CODE>:<BR><BR>

<CENTER>
<CODE> X <-read.table( 'DSL-StrongPasswordData.txt', header=TRUE ) </CODE>
</CENTER>
<BR>

<I>(Matlab and Weka)</I>: In the <A
HREF="DSL-StrongPasswordData.csv">comma-separated-value format</A>,
the columns of the table are separated by commas.  This format is
commonly read by most data-analysis packages (e.g., <A
HREF="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</A>).  The <A
HREF="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka data-mining
software</A> has collected many machine-learning algorithms that might
be brought to bear on the keystroke-dynamics data.  While Weka
encourages the use of its own <A
HREF="http://weka.wiki.sourceforge.net/ARFF">ARFF</A> data-input
format, a researcher could convert a CSV into an ARFF-formatted file
by prepending the appropriate header information.<BR><BR>

<I>(Excel)</I>: In the <A HREF="DSL-StrongPasswordData.xls">Microsoft
Excel binary-file format</A>, the columns of the table are encoded as
a standard Excel spreadsheet.  This format can be used by researchers
wishing to bring Excel's data analysis and graphing capabilities to
bear on the data.<BR><BR>

By making the data available in these three formats, we hope to make
it easier for other researchers to use their preferred data-analysis
tools.  In our own research, we use the fixed-width format and the <A
HREF="http://www.r-project.org">R</A> statistical-programming
environment.

Q2-3: How are the data structured? What do the column names mean? (And why aren't the subject IDs consecutive?)
</DIV>
<DIV id="q2-3"><DIV class="ans">
    
(NOTE: the final dataset may have more columns, so this section may
need to be updated.)<BR><BR>

The data are arranged as a table with 34 columns.  Each row of data
corresponds to the timing information for a single repetition of the
password by a single subject.  The first column, <I>subject</I>, is a
unique identifier for each subject (e.g., <CODE>s002</CODE> or
<CODE>s057</CODE>).  Even though the data set contains 51 subjects,
the identifiers do not range from <CODE>s001</CODE>
to <CODE>s051</CODE>; subjects have been assigned unique IDs across a
range of keystroke experiments, and not every subject participated in
every experiment.  For instance, Subject 1 did not perform the
password typing task and so <CODE>s001</CODE> does not appear in the
data set.  The second column, <I>sessionIndex</I>, is the session in
which the password was typed (ranging from 1 to 8).  The third
column, <I>rep</I>, is the repetition of the password within the
session (ranging from 1 to 50).<BR><BR>

The remaining 31 columns present the timing information for the
password.  The name of the column encodes the type of timing
information.  Column names of the form <CODE>H.<I>key</I></CODE>
designate a hold time for the named key (i.e., the time from when
<I>key</I> was pressed to when it was released).  Column names of the
form <CODE>DD.<I>key1</I>.<I>key2</I></CODE> designate a
keydown-keydown time for the named digraph (i.e., the time from when
<I>key1</I> was pressed to when <I>key2</I> was pressed).  Column
names of the form <CODE>UD.<I>key1</I>.<I>key2</I></CODE> designate a
keyup-keydown time for the named digraph (i.e., the time from when
<I>key1</I> was released to when <I>key2</I> was pressed).  Note that
<CODE>UD</CODE> times can be negative, and that <CODE>H</CODE> times
and <CODE>UD</CODE> times add up to <CODE>DD</CODE> times.<BR><BR>

Consider the following one-line example of what you will see in the data:
<PRE>
  subject  sessionIndex  rep      H.period   DD.period.t   UD.period.t     ...
     s002             1    1        0.1491        0.3979        0.2488     ...
</PRE>

The example presents typing data for subject 2, session 1, repetition
1.  The <CODE>period</CODE> key was held down for 0.1491 seconds
(149.1 milliseconds); the time between pressing the
<CODE>period</CODE> key and the <CODE>t</CODE> key (keydown-keydown
time) was 0.3979 seconds; the time between releasing the
<CODE>period</CODE> and pressing the <CODE>t</CODE> key (keyup-keydown
time) was 0.2488 seconds; and so on.

<H3>3. Contrasting Lab and Field Data</H3>


<DIV class="sec">

In our analysis of lab and field datasets, we discovered several 
artifacts common to data collected in the field. We present the 
artifacts below.<BR><BR>

<B>USB Polling:</B><BR>
  <div class="holder">
    <img src="polling.png" alt="polling artifacts">
  </div>
<BR><BR>

USB keyboards do not report keystrokes immediately upon a keypress. Rather, 
keystrokes are reported to the computer at a fixed timing interval set by the 
keyboard. This interval, called the polling interval, is most often a 
power of two. Since most subjects use USB keyboards, artifacts caused by USB
polling are common in field data. <BR><BR>
    
We examined the foremost datasets in the keystroke dynamics community and found 
that most contained USB polling artifacts, the only exceptions being our
own 100-subject and 51-subject lab datasets for which an external timer was 
used to timestamp keystrokes. A list of datasets that were analyzed is presented
below.<BR><BR>

<B>Keyboard Change:</B><BR>
  <div class="holder">
    <img src="keyboard_change.png" alt="keyboard change artifact">
  </div>
<BR><BR>
    
In the field, subjects may change keyboards during the experiment. Different
keyboards have different properties: different keyboard matrix scan rates, 
actuation points, polling intervals, and baud rates to name a few. These differences
can cause unpredictable changes in the collected data. In our dataset, these changes
typically manifest in a mean shift of the data, change in observed polling interval, 
or both.<BR><BR>
    
<B>Bursts:</B><BR>
  <div class="holder">
    <img src="bursts.png" alt="burst artifacts">
  </div><BR><BR>
    
One of the hazards of collecting data in the field is that the processing load on a
subject's computer cannot be controlled. In the cases that the processing load is high,
input lag may cause many keystrokes to be recorded at once&mdash;in a burst. We see
some occurrences of this in our field dataset, where many consecutive features are
recorded in quick succession, all presenting times of around 0ms.<BR><BR>
    
<B>Ramps:</B><BR>
  <div class="holder">
    <img src="ramps.png" alt="ramp artifacts">
  </div>
<BR><BR>
    

There exist several subjects for whom certain hold features have times that either 
regularly increase or decrease over the course of a session. The cause of this artifact
remains unknown. Perhaps related to this anomaly is a widening gap around 0ms in the
up-down latency times for those same subjects. Because the regular increasing/decreasing
nature of the data when plotted is reminiscent of a ramp, we call these ramp 
artifacts.<BR><BR>
    


<B>Common questions:</B>

<UL>

<LI> <DIV class="hdr" onclick="switchDisplay('q3-1');">
Q3-1: Can you tell me what the polling intervals for subjects in your field dataset are?
</DIV>

<DIV id="q3-1"><DIV class="ans">
    
Yes. To accomplish this, we created two different programs to independently 
estimate polling intervals in our field dataset. Each program outputs both an estimate
and a level of supporting evidence on a scale from 0-2. A 0 represents no evidence and a 
2 represents the highest level of evidence. The output of both programs were combined to
create a total level of evidence scale from 0-4, when the programs agreed on the polling
interval. The following table presents the subjects whose polling interval was identified
with the highest level of evidence&mdash;a score of 4&mdash;from both programs. Bear in mind that this not 
a comprehensive list of subjects and their polling rates, just those that we could
identify polling intevals for with a high level of evidence.<BR><BR>

Certainly. This list is by no means comprehensive; it just presents the artifacts that we

There are a few steps that can be taken to diminish the effect of some of these 
artifacts, but many of the confounding factors that are at the source of these artifacts
can never be fully eliminated. The only solution, then, is to use an external timer to 
timestamp keystrokes. If this is not an option, then the following measures may be 
taken:<BR><BR>

<UL>
    <LI> USB Polling: Have subjects use either PS/2 keyboards or USB keyboards with a
         low polling interval (such as gaming keyboards).
    <LI> Keyboard Change: Ensure that subjects do not change keyboards for the duration
         of the experiment.
    <LI> Bursts: Encourage subjects to close programs running on their computer before 
         contributing data.
    <LI> Ramps: Since the cause of the ramps is unknown, we cannot provide any advice 
         on how to avoid them. We encourage researchers to examine their data throughout
         their experiments to avoid collecting data with ramps.

<H3>4. Lab vs Field Impact on Classification</H3>

<DIV class="sec">
<!--
The following table ranks 14 anomaly detectors based on their average
equal-error rates.  The evaluation procedure described in the script
above was used to obtain the equal-error rates for each anomaly
detector.  For example, the average equal-error rate for the scaled
Manhattan detector (across all subjects) was 9.62%, and the standard
deviation was 0.0694.<BR><BR>
    
-->
In our analysis of the foremost datasets in the keystroke dynamics community, we
identified USB polling as one of the most common artifacts present in field data. 
To assess the impact that polling has on classification, we compare the performance of 
classifiers run on our lab dataset, which contains no artifacts, and the same 
classifiers run on a degraded version of our lab dataset in order to emulate polling
artifacts.<BR><BR>
    
The same evaluation methodology was used for all of the classifiers described here
and is the same method presented in our paper at the DSN 2009 conference. We 
direct readers to that paper for more details on the classifier evaluation
methodology.<BR><BR>
    
<B>Polling Effect on Equal-Error Rate:</B><BR><BR>

When evaluating a classifier, we desire a metric to summarize its performance.
For the classifiers assessed here, this metric is given as the average equal-error rate 
(EER). Changes in average EER as the lab dataset is degraded will indicate, at a high 
level, how the performance of the classifier is affected by polling. We begin the 
comparison by first establishing a baseline average EER for the classifier. The baseline 
is the average EER when the classifier is run on the unquantized lab dataset. Then, we 
compare the baseline to the performance of the classifier on varying degradations of the 
lab data.<BR><BR>

The comparison between the baseline average EER and degraded average EER is standardized 
through the use of percent error:  <BR><BR>
     percent error = ( abs( baseline - observed ) / baseline ) · 100 . <BR><BR>
The advantage of using percent error is that it facilitates comparison between many 
classifiers that may have different baseline average EERs. The classification results
from four of the current top-performing classifiers&mdash;a Gaussian Mixture Model 
(GMM), Mahalanobis Distance Classifier (Mahalanobis), a Mahalanobis KNN 
(NearestNeighbor), and a Scaled Manhattan Distance Classifier (ScaledManhattan)
&mdash; for power-of-two polling intervals (since those are the most common) are 
presented in the table below.<BR><BR>

<B>Polling Effect on Subject Misclassifications:</B><BR><BR>
    
The full impact of polling on classification is not revealed solely by examining 
performance metrics. The subjects who are misclassified by the classifier are also
prone to change due to the effects of polling. For a complete treatment of the effect
of polling on misclassification, we refer readers to our paper. Here, we provide an 
example of what can change when only one subject in the dataset provides data with
polling artifacts:<BR><BR>
    
s040 after adding an 8ms polling interval to their data:
    
<UL>
    <LI> Before polling, 151 of testing vectors from s040 were correctly classified.
         After polling, only 131 of testing vectors from s040 were correctly classified.
    <LI> 46 subjects were classified differently by s040's detector after polling 
         artifacts were added to their data.
    <LI> After polling, 17 subjects were misclassified as s040 who were not 
         misclassified before. In an actual biometric system, this would mean 17 people
         were falsely accused of breaking into s017's account.

<B>Common questions:</B>


<UL>

<LI> <DIV class="hdr" onclick="switchDisplay('q4-1');">
Q4-1: How was the lab data degraded?
</DIV>

<DIV id="q4-1"><DIV class="ans">

The degradation procedure is given by the following function where 'hi' is
a feature (hold, up-down latency, or down-down latency) time in the high-
resolution lab dataset, 'lo' is a feature time in the degraded lab dataset, δ is
the polling interval, and the round function implements a round-to-even policy:<BR><BR>
    
lo = δ · round( hi / δ )<BR><BR>

A round-to-even rounding policy was used to avoid the possible confound of biasing the 
data. In addition to being unbiased, a round-to-even is representative of data collected 
over USB. Consider the following scenarios for a polling interval of 8ms -- meaning the 
computer collects keystrokes from the keyboard buffer every 8ms. All times are absolute 
(starting from time t = 0) and each scenario is equally likely:<BR><BR>

<UL>
    <LI>The user presses a key down at t = 1ms. The computer will not record the keydown 
        until t = 8ms -- the time of the next poll. Then, at time t = 16ms, the user 
        releases the key. Since the key was released on a multiple of 8, the computer 
        registers the keyup at t = 16ms. The user's actual hold time was 15ms, but the 
        computer registered your hold time as 8ms. This is a situation where the 
        computer recorded a hold time that was less than the user's actual hold time due 
        to polling.
    <LI>The user presses the key down at t = 8ms. The computer will record the keydown 
        at t = 8ms because it is a multiple of the polling interval. Then, at time t 
        = 17ms, the user releases the key. Since the user did not release the key on a 
        multiple of the polling interval, the computer registers the keyup at t = 24ms 
        -- the next multiple of the polling interval. The user's actual hold time was 
        9ms, but the computer registered their hold time as 16ms. This is a situation 
        where the computer recorded a hold time that was greater than the user's actual 
        hold time due to polling.

<LI> <DIV class="hdr" onclick="switchDisplay('q4-2');">
Q4-2: How do I interpret the table of classification results?
</DIV>

<DIV id="q4-2"><DIV class="ans">

The first column indicates the name of the detector.  All of the
detectors in this list bear the names they were given in our original
paper.  The names are meant to describe the mathematical or
statistical technique that underlies the anomaly-detection strategy.
The reader interested in how each detector works will find additional
detail in the prose and references of our DSN 2009 paper.<BR><BR>

The second column presents the polling interval to which the lab dataset
was degraded before the detector was run. For example, a value of 8 in
this column indicates that the lab dataset was degraded to emulate a polling
interval of 8ms for all subjects.<BR><BR>

The third column provides the average equal-error rate of each
detector, as estimated by the evaluation methodology in the DSN 2009 paper.
<BR><BR>
    
The fourth column presents the percent error between the average equal-error 
rate in the third column and the baseline average equal-error rate for that 
detector (the average equal-error rate with no polling). Lower values for 
percent error indicate that a detector is more robust against polling artifacts
in the dataset.<BR><BR>

Note that these results are only the observed results of
a single evaluation on a single data set.  We would discourage a
reader from inferring that the better-performing detectors are necessarily
going to always outperform the other detectors.  We believe it is
likely that many factors&mdash;who the subjects are, what they type,
and specifically how the data are collected and analyzed&mdash;affect
the error rates of anomaly detectors used for keystroke dynamics.
Variations in these factors might change a detector's equal-error
rate, and might cause a different set of detectors to be among the top
performers.  A low percent error in this table suggests that a detector is
promising; but more data, and more evaluations will be needed to
determine how various factors affect keystroke-dynamics error rates.
This topic is a subject of our current and ongoing research.

</DIV></DIV>

<LI> <DIV class="hdr" onclick="switchDisplay('q4-3');">
Q4-3: Why do you use the average equal-error rate as the sole measure of
performance?
</DIV>

<DIV id="q4-3"><DIV class="ans">

Summarizing the performance of an anomaly detector as a single number
is tricky.  There is no right way to do it that does not make some
concessions, or have some drawbacks.  As such, researchers in the
field have used a variety of measures.  In the original paper, we
reported both the equal-error rate and the zero-miss false-alarm rate,
since they are both used in the literature.  On this webpage, we
tabulate the equal-error rate of each detector because it is a common
measure of performance for many biometric systems.  If other,
demonstrably better measures of performance emerge, we will consider
the feasibility of calculating them on our evaluation data, and
updating this page with these better measures.
