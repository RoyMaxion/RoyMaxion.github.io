                    evaluation so that other researchers can use the data, reproduce our

                    related topics, such as intrusion, masquerader or insider detection.
                    We hope these resources will be useful to the research

                        Keystroke dynamics is the study of whether people can be distinguished
                        by their typing rhythms, much like handwriting is used to identify the
                        author of a written text.  Possible applications include acting as an
                        electronic fingerprint, or in an access-control mechanism.  A digital
                        fingerprint would tie a person to a computer-based crime in the same
                        manner that a physical fingerprint ties a person to the scene of a
                        physical crime.  Access control could incorporate keystroke dynamics
                        both by requiring a legitimate user to type a password with the
                        correct rhythm, and by continually authenticating that user while they
                        type on the keyboard.

                        In the field of keystroke dynamics, there are many different methods of collecting timing data from subjects. A data collection program can run in the browser, separate copies of the program can run on the personal computer of each subject, or a single program can run on one computer in a laboratory setting. In our paper, we show that collecting data outside of the laboratory setting can result in low-quality data. <BR><BR>

                                <p>For complete details of our data collection methodology, we refer
                                    readers to our original paper <A HREF="#ref1">[1]</A>.  A brief
                                summary of our methodology follows.</p>

                                <B>Lab:</B>

                                <p>We built a keystroke data-collection apparatus consisting of: (1) a
                                    laptop running Windows XP; (2) a Windows software application for presenting
                                    stimuli to the subjects, and for recording their keystrokes; and (3)
                                    an external reference timer for timestamping those keystrokes.  The
                                    software presents the subject with the password to be typed.  As the
                                    subject types the password, it is checked for correctness.  If the
                                    subject makes a typographical error, the application prompts the
                                    subject to retype the password.  In this manner, we record timestamps
                                for 50 correctly typed passwords in each session.</p>

                                <p>Whenever the subject presses or releases a key, the software
                                    application records the event (i.e., keydown or keyup), the name of
                                    the key involved, and a timestamp for the moment at which the
                                    keystroke event occurred.  An external reference clock was used to
                                    generate highly accurate timestamps.  The reference clock was
                                    demonstrated to be accurate to within &#xb1;200 microseconds (by using
                                    a function generator to simulate key presses at fixed
                                intervals).</p>

                                <p>We recruited 100 subjects (typists) from within a university community.
                                    All subjects typed the same password, and each subject typed the
                                    password 400 times over 8 sessions (50 repetitions per session).  They
                                    waited at least one day between sessions, to capture some of the
                                    day-to-day variation of each subject's typing.  The password
                                    (<CODE>.tie5Roanl</CODE>) was chosen to be representative of a strong
                                10-character password.</p>

                                <p>The raw records of all the subjects' keystrokes and timestamps were
                                    analyzed to create a password-timing table.  The password-timing table
                                    encodes the timing features for each of the 400 passwords that each
                                subject typed.</p>

                                <B>Field:</B>

                                <p>The same Windows application used to collect data for our lab dataset was 
                                    adapted to run on the personal computer of each subject in our field dataset. 
                                    Keystrokes were timestamped using two onboard timers available to Windows
                                    programs: the Query Performance Counter (QPC) for high-resolution timestamps 
                                    and the Tick Timer for standard, low-resolution timestamps. Only timing data 
                                    from the QPC is presented in the field dataset; the Tick Timer timestamps were 
                                used for sanity-checking our results.</p>

                                <p>We recruited 100 subjects from various university communities. All 100 
                                    subjects are distinct from the subjects in the lab dataset&mdash;there are no
                                    subjects who contributed to both datasets. As in the lab dataset, all subjects
                                    typed the same password (<CODE>.tie5Roanl</CODE>), and each subject typed the 
                                password 400 times over 8 sessions (50 repetitions per session). </p>

                                <p>The password-timing table for the field data was generated from the raw data 
                                    in the same manner as the password-timing table for the lab data. Likewise, 
                                    the field data password-timing table encodes the timing features for each of 
                                the 400 passwords that each subject typed.</p>

                                The data are arranged as a table with 34 columns.  Each row of data
                                corresponds to the timing information for a single repetition of the
                                password by a single subject.  The first column, <I>subject</I>, is a
                                unique identifier for each subject (e.g., <CODE>s002</CODE> or
                                <CODE>s057</CODE>).  Even though the data set contains 51 subjects,
                                the identifiers do not range from <CODE>s001</CODE>
                                to <CODE>s051</CODE>; subjects have been assigned unique IDs across a
                                range of keystroke experiments, and not every subject participated in
                                every experiment.  For instance, Subject 1 did not perform the
                                password typing task and so <CODE>s001</CODE> does not appear in the
                                data set.  The second column, <I>sessionIndex</I>, is the session in
                                which the password was typed (ranging from 1 to 8).  The third
                                column, <I>rep</I>, is the repetition of the password within the
                                session (ranging from 1 to 50).<BR><BR>

                                The remaining 31 columns present the timing information for the
                                password.  The name of the column encodes the type of timing
                                information.  Column names of the form <CODE>H.<I>key</I></CODE>
                                designate a hold time for the named key (i.e., the time from when
                                <I>key</I> was pressed to when it was released).  Column names of the
                                form <CODE>DD.<I>key1</I>.<I>key2</I></CODE> designate a
                                keydown-keydown time for the named digraph (i.e., the time from when
                                <I>key1</I> was pressed to when <I>key2</I> was pressed).  Column
                                names of the form <CODE>UD.<I>key1</I>.<I>key2</I></CODE> designate a
                                keyup-keydown time for the named digraph (i.e., the time from when
                                <I>key1</I> was released to when <I>key2</I> was pressed).  Note that
                                <CODE>UD</CODE> times can be negative, and that <CODE>H</CODE> times
                                and <CODE>UD</CODE> times add up to <CODE>DD</CODE> times.<BR><BR>

                                Consider the following one-line example of what you will see in the data:
                                <PRE>
                                    subject  sessionIndex  rep      H.period   DD.period.t   UD.period.t     ...

                                </PRE>

                                The example presents typing data for subject 2, session 1, repetition
                                1.  The <CODE>period</CODE> key was held down for 0.1491 seconds
                                (149.1 milliseconds); the time between pressing the
                                <CODE>period</CODE> key and the <CODE>t</CODE> key (keydown-keydown
                                time) was 0.3979 seconds; the time between releasing the
                                <CODE>period</CODE> and pressing the <CODE>t</CODE> key (keyup-keydown
                                time) was 0.2488 seconds; and so on.

                            In our analysis of lab and field datasets, we discovered several 
                            artifacts common to data collected in the field. We present the 
                            artifacts below.<BR><BR>

                            <h3>USB Polling:</h3>

                            <p>USB keyboards do not report keystrokes immediately upon a keypress. Rather, 
                                keystrokes are reported to the computer at a fixed timing interval set by the 
                                keyboard. This interval, called the polling interval, is most often a 
                                power of two. Since most subjects use USB keyboards, artifacts caused by USB
                            polling are common in field data. </p>

                            <p>We examined the foremost datasets in the keystroke dynamics community and found 
                                that most contained USB polling artifacts, the only exceptions being our
                                own 100-subject and 51-subject lab datasets for which an external timer was 
                                used to timestamp keystrokes. A list of datasets that were analyzed is presented
                            below.</p>

                            <h3>Keyboard Change:</h3>

                            <p>In the field, subjects may change keyboards during the experiment. Different
                                keyboards have different properties: different keyboard matrix scan rates, 
                                actuation points, polling intervals, and baud rates to name a few. These differences
                                can cause unpredictable changes in the collected data. In our dataset, these changes
                                typically manifest in a mean shift of the data, change in observed polling interval, 
                            or both.</p>

                            <h3>Bursts:</h3>
                            <div class="holder">

                            </div>

                            <p>One of the hazards of collecting data in the field is that the processing load on a
                                subject's computer cannot be controlled. In the cases that the processing load is high,
                                input lag may cause many keystrokes to be recorded at once&mdash;in a burst. We see
                                some occurrences of this in our field dataset, where many consecutive features are
                            recorded in quick succession, all presenting times of around 0ms.</p>

                            <h3>Ramps:</h3>

                            <p>There exist several subjects for whom certain hold features have times that either 
                                regularly increase or decrease over the course of a session. The cause of this artifact
                                remains unknown. Perhaps related to this anomaly is a widening gap around 0ms in the
                                up-down latency times for those same subjects. Because the regular increasing/decreasing
                                nature of the data when plotted is reminiscent of a ramp, we call these ramp 
                            artifacts.</p>

                                    Yes. To accomplish this, we created two different programs to independently 
                                    estimate polling intervals in our field dataset. Each program outputs both an estimate
                                    and a level of supporting evidence on a scale from 0-2. A 0 represents no evidence and a 
                                    2 represents the highest level of evidence. The output of both programs were combined to
                                    create a total level of evidence scale from 0-4, when the programs agreed on the polling
                                    interval. The following table presents the subjects whose polling interval was identified
                                    with the highest level of evidence&mdash;a score of 4&mdash;from both programs. Bear in mind that this not

                                    identify polling intevals for with a high level of evidence.<BR><BR>

<!--
The following table ranks 14 anomaly detectors based on their average
equal-error rates.  The evaluation procedure described in the script
above was used to obtain the equal-error rates for each anomaly
detector.  For example, the average equal-error rate for the scaled
Manhattan detector (across all subjects) was 9.62%, and the standard
deviation was 0.0694.
    
-->
<p>In our analysis of the foremost datasets in the keystroke dynamics community, we
    identified USB polling as one of the most common artifacts present in field data. 
    To assess the impact that polling has on classification, we compare the performance of 
    classifiers run on our lab dataset, which contains no artifacts, and the same 
    classifiers run on a degraded version of our lab dataset in order to emulate polling
artifacts.</p>

<p>The same evaluation methodology was used for all of the classifiers described here
    and is the same method presented in our paper at the DSN 2009 conference. We 
    direct readers to that paper for more details on the classifier evaluation
methodology.</p>

<h3>Polling Effect on Equal-Error Rate:</h3>

<p>When evaluating a classifier, we desire a metric to summarize its performance.
    For the classifiers assessed here, this metric is given as the average equal-error rate 
    (EER). Changes in average EER as the lab dataset is degraded will indicate, at a high 
    level, how the performance of the classifier is affected by polling. We begin the 
    comparison by first establishing a baseline average EER for the classifier. The baseline 
    is the average EER when the classifier is run on the unquantized lab dataset. Then, we 
    compare the baseline to the performance of the classifier on varying degradations of the 
lab data.</p>

<p>The comparison between the baseline average EER and degraded average EER is standardized 
through the use of percent error:  </p>
<p>percent error = ( abs( baseline - observed ) / baseline ) · 100 . </p>
<p>The advantage of using percent error is that it facilitates comparison between many 
    classifiers that may have different baseline average EERs. The classification results
    from four of the current top-performing classifiers&mdash;a Gaussian Mixture Model 
    (GMM), Mahalanobis Distance Classifier (Mahalanobis), a Mahalanobis KNN 
    (NearestNeighbor), and a Scaled Manhattan Distance Classifier (ScaledManhattan)
    &mdash; for power-of-two polling intervals (since those are the most common) are 
presented in the table below.</p>

    <h3>Polling Effect on Subject Misclassifications:</h3>
    
    <p>The full impact of polling on classification is not revealed solely by examining 
        performance metrics. The subjects who are misclassified by the classifier are also
        prone to change due to the effects of polling. For a complete treatment of the effect
        of polling on misclassification, we refer readers to our paper. Here, we provide an 
        example of what can change when only one subject in the dataset provides data with
    polling artifacts:</p>
    
    <p>s040 after adding an 8ms polling interval to their data:</p>
    
    <UL>
        <LI> Before polling, 151 of testing vectors from s040 were correctly classified.
        After polling, only 131 of testing vectors from s040 were correctly classified.</LI>
        <LI> 46 subjects were classified differently by s040's detector after polling 
        artifacts were added to their data.</LI>
        <LI> After polling, 17 subjects were misclassified as s040 who were not 
            misclassified before. In an actual biometric system, this would mean 17 people
        were falsely accused of breaking into s017's account.</LI>

    <h3>Common questions:</h3>


    <UL>

        <LI> <DIV class="hdr" onclick="switchDisplay('q4-1');">
            Q4-1: How was the lab data degraded?
        </DIV></LI>

        <DIV id="q4-1"><DIV class="ans">

            The degradation procedure is given by the following function where 'hi' is
            a feature (hold, up-down latency, or down-down latency) time in the high-
            resolution lab dataset, 'lo' is a feature time in the degraded lab dataset, δ is
            the polling interval, and the round function implements a round-to-even policy:<BR><BR>

            lo = δ · round( hi / δ )<BR><BR>

            A round-to-even rounding policy was used to avoid the possible confound of biasing the 
            data. In addition to being unbiased, a round-to-even is representative of data collected 
            over USB. Consider the following scenarios for a polling interval of 8ms -- meaning the 
            computer collects keystrokes from the keyboard buffer every 8ms. All times are absolute 
            (starting from time t = 0) and each scenario is equally likely:<BR><BR>

            <UL>
                <LI>The user presses a key down at t = 1ms. The computer will not record the keydown 
                    until t = 8ms -- the time of the next poll. Then, at time t = 16ms, the user 
                    releases the key. Since the key was released on a multiple of 8, the computer 
                    registers the keyup at t = 16ms. The user's actual hold time was 15ms, but the 
                    computer registered your hold time as 8ms. This is a situation where the 
                    computer recorded a hold time that was less than the user's actual hold time due 
                to polling.</LI>
                <LI>The user presses the key down at t = 8ms. The computer will record the keydown 
                    at t = 8ms because it is a multiple of the polling interval. Then, at time t 
                    = 17ms, the user releases the key. Since the user did not release the key on a 
                    multiple of the polling interval, the computer registers the keyup at t = 24ms 
                    -- the next multiple of the polling interval. The user's actual hold time was 
                    9ms, but the computer registered their hold time as 16ms. This is a situation 
                    where the computer recorded a hold time that was greater than the user's actual 
                hold time due to polling.</LI>

        <LI> <DIV class="hdr" onclick="switchDisplay('q4-2');">
            Q4-2: How do I interpret the table of classification results?
        </DIV></LI>

        <DIV id="q4-2"><DIV class="ans">

            The first column indicates the name of the detector.  All of the
            detectors in this list bear the names they were given in our original
            paper.  The names are meant to describe the mathematical or
            statistical technique that underlies the anomaly-detection strategy.
            The reader interested in how each detector works will find additional
            detail in the prose and references of our DSN 2009 paper.<BR><BR>

            The second column presents the polling interval to which the lab dataset
            was degraded before the detector was run. For example, a value of 8 in
            this column indicates that the lab dataset was degraded to emulate a polling
            interval of 8ms for all subjects.<BR><BR>

            The third column provides the average equal-error rate of each
            detector, as estimated by the evaluation methodology in the DSN 2009 paper.
            <BR><BR>

            The fourth column presents the percent error between the average equal-error 
            rate in the third column and the baseline average equal-error rate for that 
            detector (the average equal-error rate with no polling). Lower values for 
            percent error indicate that a detector is more robust against polling artifacts
            in the dataset.<BR><BR>

            Note that these results are only the observed results of
            a single evaluation on a single data set.  We would discourage a
            reader from inferring that the better-performing detectors are necessarily
            going to always outperform the other detectors.  We believe it is
            likely that many factors&mdash;who the subjects are, what they type,
            and specifically how the data are collected and analyzed&mdash;affect
            the error rates of anomaly detectors used for keystroke dynamics.
            Variations in these factors might change a detector's equal-error
            rate, and might cause a different set of detectors to be among the top
            performers.  A low percent error in this table suggests that a detector is
            promising; but more data, and more evaluations will be needed to
            determine how various factors affect keystroke-dynamics error rates.
            This topic is a subject of our current and ongoing research.

        <LI> <DIV class="hdr" onclick="switchDisplay('q4-3');">
            Q4-3: Why do you use the average equal-error rate as the sole measure of
            performance?
        </DIV></LI>

        <DIV id="q4-3"><DIV class="ans">

            Summarizing the performance of an anomaly detector as a single number
            is tricky.  There is no right way to do it that does not make some
            concessions, or have some drawbacks.  As such, researchers in the
            field have used a variety of measures.  In the original paper, we
            reported both the equal-error rate and the zero-miss false-alarm rate,
            since they are both used in the literature.  On this webpage, we
            tabulate the equal-error rate of each detector because it is a common
            measure of performance for many biometric systems.  If other,
            demonstrably better measures of performance emerge, we will consider
            the feasibility of calculating them on our evaluation data, and
            updating this page with these better measures.
